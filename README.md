Tech lover, advocate for Women in Tech and Digital Inclusion. I'm a full-stack developer, recently graduated from [Makers](https://makers.tech/) Academy and looking for a role where I can refine my craft in software development and solve real problems.

I am a proud member and a director of CoderDojo London - a free, volunteer-led, community-based computer programming club for young people.

My involvement began in 2013, when I was searching for my work-related project at Birkbeck University. I proposed making a website for the London CoderDojo community. Before I knew it, I was helping and mentoring young people at the Dojos. It was during those meetings about the website, when all the questions raised led to us establishing the London CoderDojo CIC. I feel privileged and proud to be one of the appointed directors.

# Skills

### Problem Solving

During my study at Birkbeck University, I took a module called _Problem solving for programming_ and learnt how to abstract sub-problems, identify decision criteria and develop multiple solutions.

I was able to apply my problem-solving skills for each challenge we were tasked to do at Makers. My coaches also commented that they were confident in my approach to problem-solving and computation in a logical and well-reasoned manner.

### Aptitude for learning

My approach to learning has become more methodical and efficient since I joined Makers. I have improved in my ability to know what to ask and where to get answers that are useful.

I have always had a curious mind and enjoy learning new languages and challenges. When Apple first launched Swift Playgrounds in 2014, we (CoderDojo London) were invited by Apple to test it in our Dojos. I took this challenge and taught myself Swift and Xcode. Since 2014 I have been running Dojos teaching SP and been communicating with Apple for a regular feedback including presentations of my experience in Apple's workshops.

### Communication and Collaboration

I have gained invaluable experience from being part of the CoderDojo movement and some of the skills include:  
- Overseeing the development and supporting the clubs in the London Area.
- We have over 1,500 subscribers and run (270 events since 2013)
- As part of your mission for Digital inclusion, Regularly run _Girls-Only Dojos_ at UCL, Thompson Reuters and John Lewis etc.
- Some past events are listed on
[eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/coderdojo-london-8226218245)
- I've been contributing to the testing and feedback of Apple's product (Swift Playgrounds) in our Dojos since 2014.

Learning and sharing is second nature for me and I believe I demonstrated this through my long-standing commitment to Coderdojo movement.

Furthermore, during my team projects at Makers, I learnt to collaborate, adhering to agile ceremonies such as daily stand-ups, sprints and retros, and I learnt to communicate better, learn from others as well as share my knowledge so we can all grow and progress towards achieving our goals.

### Personal Projects

I have continued to learn Swift and run the CoderDojo Swift track regularly at UsTwo, Shoreditch. In recognition of my commitment, I was invited to attend Apple’s residential short course and Apple's Swift Educator Summit in Berlin in celebration of [EU-Code week](https://codeweek.eu//)(October 2018) where I had the opportunity to participate in hands-on workshops on Swift Playgrounds and App Development with Swift and meet engineers, curriculum experts and evangelists from Apple.

These are the projects that I have completed outside of Apple’s training and you can see it on Github​ The list will continue to grow.

# Interests

I love tennis and often play at my local social club for a match and fun games. I gave up my car many moons ago to do my bit in helping our planet and cycling is my main means of transport, that is if the heavens haven't opened.
